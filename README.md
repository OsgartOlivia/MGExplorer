# MG-Explorer 

## Context

This project was initially created and developed by one of M.Winckler's student for a thesis
on the incremental search for information.

In our case, we collect data about authors and co-authors from **dlpb** (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/).

## My work

I currently am on this project in order to increase the usability of the used visualization techniques.
Moreover, my second goal is to add new visualization techniques.

## Run the project

You need to open via your localhost or your Webstorm the file `inf-UFRGS-MGExplorer.html`.

Or you can run the command `npm install -g http-server` in your terminal, at the root
of the project.

Then, you just need to run `http-server`, it will display you three addresses, choose one
and add `/inf-UFRGS-MGExplorer.html` in the url.
